Life, grant me the serenity
To accept the things I cannot change;
Courage to change the things I can;
And wisdom to know the difference.

Living one day at a time;
Enjoying one moment at a time;
Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace;
Taking this challenging world

As it is, not as I would have it;
Trusting that all things will be made right
If I surrender to this trust;
So that I may be reasonably happy in this life

And amazed by it
Forever and ever in its eternity.
Amen.
