# New-Serenity
Serenity for everyone

The Serenity prayer recites for those who seek them, the important teacings of acceptance, understanding, peace, correct action and more. The value from such teachings is not limited to people of any specific faith, language, culture, sex, nationality, race or other definition.

Therefore I saw fit to adapt the wonderful teachings of Reinhold Neibuhr in such a way that all people can benefit from them without the need to recite parts that go against their heart.

-------------------------------
Since all faiths and non faiths can have serenity and life is the common giver to all, the word 'God' is replaced with 'Life'

- God grant me the serenity (original)
- Life, grant me the serenity

-------------------------------
Unchanged

- To accept the things I cannot change;
- Courage to change the things I can;
- And wisdom to know the difference.

-------------------------------
Unchanged

- Living one day at a time;
- Enjoying one moment at a time;
- Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace;

-------------------------------
Instead of speaking of one, we can speak of all (as he did). Instead of speaking only of the challanges of sin, we speak of all challanges, including such as the lack of ambition, an enemy of self realization and therefore of the fulfilment and purpose the writer inspires.

- Taking, as He did, this sinful world (original)
- Taking, as many great did, the challanges of life

-------------------------------
Unchanged

- As it is, not as I would have it;

-------------------------------
As disagreement may exist regarding who or what may make things right, trust is that things will be made right (in whatever way they do)

- Trusting that He will make all things right (original)
- Trusting that all things are right

-------------------------------
Regardless of who or what induces will, it is and can therefore be accepted 

- If I surrender to His Will; (original)
- If I surrender to this will;

-------------------------------
Unchanged

- So that I may be reasonably happy in this life

-------------------------------
Amazement to praise creation as well as existense. A creator is also happy with praise of their creation, even if such praise is not directed specifically at them.

And supremely happy with Him (original)
And amazed with life

-------------------------------
Any type of reincarnation or the lack of it exists within eternity

Forever and ever in the next. (original)
Forever and ever its eternity.

-------------------------------
As Amen can be a declaration of agreement, praise or other things, so can a decalration of meaning mean such things 

Amen.
imean.



I wish you find what you seek in these wonderful teachings by Reinhold Neibuhr
