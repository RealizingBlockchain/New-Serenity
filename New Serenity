Life, grant me the serenity
To accept the things I cannot change;
Courage to change the things I can;
And wisdom to know the difference.

Living one day at a time;
Enjoying one moment at a time;
Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace;
Taking, as many great did, the challanges of life

As it is, not as I would have it;
Trusting that all things are right
If I surrender to this will;
So that I may be reasonably happy in this life

And amazed with life
Forever and ever its eternity.
