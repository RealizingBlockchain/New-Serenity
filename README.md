# New-Serenity
Serenity for everyone

The Serenity prayer is recited by those who seek important teachings of acceptance, understanding, peace, correct action and more. The value from such teachings is not limited to people of any specific faith, language, culture, sex, nationality, race or other definition.

Therefore I saw fit to adapt the wonderful teachings of Reinhold Neibuhr in such a way that all people can benefit from them without the need to recite parts that go against their heart.

-------------------------------
Since all faiths and non faiths can have serenity and life is the common giver to all, the word 'God' is replaced with 'Life'

- God grant me the serenity (original)
- Life, grant me the serenity

-------------------------------
Unchanged

- To accept the things I cannot change;
- Courage to change the things I can;
- And wisdom to know the difference.

-------------------------------
Unchanged

- Living one day at a time;
- Enjoying one moment at a time;
- Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace;

-------------------------------
Instead of speaking of one, we can speak of all (as he did). Instead of speaking only of the challenges of sin, we speak of all challenges, including for example the lack of ambition, an enemy of self-realization and therefore of the fulfilment and purpose the writer inspires.

- Taking, as He did, this sinful world (original)
- Taking this challenging world

-------------------------------
Unchanged

- As it is, not as I would have it;

-------------------------------
As disagreement may exist regarding who or what may make things right, we trust that things will be made right (in whatever way they do)

- Trusting that He will make all things right (original)
- Trusting that all things will be made right

-------------------------------
Instead of defining who we put our trust in, we trust ourselves in whatever we trust. 

- If I surrender to His Will; (original)
- If I surrender to this trust;

-------------------------------
Unchanged

- So that I may be reasonably happy in this life

-------------------------------
Amazement to praise creation as well as existense. A creator is also happy with praise of their creation, even if such praise is not directed specifically at them.

- And supremely happy with Him (original)
- And amazed by it

-------------------------------
Any type of reincarnation or the lack of it exists within eternity

- Forever and ever in the next. (original)
- Forever and ever in its eternity.

-------------------------------
Unchanged. Although Amen has a religious connotation, it simply means an agreement with what was said.

- Amen.




I wish you find what you seek in these wonderful teachings by Reinhold Neibuhr
